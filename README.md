# AutoLeak

AutoLeak is a Terminal-Based utility that interacts with varius Fortnite API's. AutoLeak can generate leaked cosmetics, merge images, search for cosmetics in a dynamic pak file, and interact with Twitter, if you have Twitter API keys. AutoLeak is also fully customizable, as you can add watermarks, change the API you want to use, choose one of the three icon types we offer, or change the placeholder image of a cosmetic. It's all up to YOU on how you want AutoLeak to look like!

Make sure to check out our Wiki, with info on how to utilitize [**settings.json**](https://github.com/FortniteFevers/AutoLeak/wiki/Settings.json-With-Comments), and information on the latest AutoLeak versions.

# Features
AutoLeak is a program with many features.
Currently, the program features these options:

- Custom icon generation
- Full Twitter support! Tweet out new cosmetics or any cosmetic you want using [Twitter API keys](https://developer.twitter.com/)
- Grab new cosmetics when there's a new update pushed out
- **CUSTOMIZATION!** Customize AutoLeak however you want! Either it's by using a different language, putting a watermark on an image, or changing the icon type your using! It's all up to YOU on how you want AutoLeak to look like! (You can customize AutoLeak in the settings.json file, read [here](https://github.com/FortniteFevers/AutoLeak/wiki/Settings.json-With-Comments) on how to use it)
- Image merging! When generating new cosmetics, or if you just want to merge some images, AutoLeak can merge all images in the icons folder into one image in seconds! AutoLeak does this automatically if you have the "MergeImages" feature turned to True. If you don't want to do this automatically, you can easily just use the merged images command!
- 3 different icon generation types! You can either use the "new" type (which is what i reccomend), the "standard" type, or the "clean" type. Heres some examples of each icon type:    [new](https://i.ibb.co/gth5ggC/CID-703-Athena-Commando-M-Cyclone.png)     [standard]()     [clean]() [large](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/810723482387480587/913123217298817114/CID_A_262_Athena_Commando_M_HeadbandK.png) (click on each icon type to see what it looks like!)
- Update mode! (works best when connected to twitter). This automatically tweets out when a new update is pushed. It tweets out the updates AES key, Version, Map, and of course, new cosmetics, all generated by AutoLeak.

There's **MANY** more features as well, so make sure to check them out by downloading the program!
